Cells Client provides an easy way to communicate with a [Pydio Cells](https://github.com/pydio/cells) server instance from the command line (or from automation scripts). It uses the [Cells SDK for Go](https://github.com/pydio/cells-sdk-go) and the REST API under the hood.

Cells Client a.k.a `cec` works like standard command line tools like **ls**, **scp**, etc.  Using the `cec` command, you can list, download and upload directly to your remote Cells server.

This project is being developed under v2 version and the active codebase is on the master branch in `v2/` [subdirectory of this reposiory](https://github.com/pydio/cells-client/tree/master/v2).
